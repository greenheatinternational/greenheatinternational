  - heading: Our Tailored Biogas Solutions
    text: It all starts with a free feasibility study (we are highly experienced conducting over 3,000 to date). From the waste available for feedstock, we determine the biogas potential and the capacity size of your digester. We will then provide the full design and construction tailored to the site requirements.

    text: Our portable digesters are quick and easy to install and are best suited for small farms and households. The plastic casing is fed with organic waste and will expand as biogas is produced. The gas is safely tapped off for a clean cooking and heating fuel.
