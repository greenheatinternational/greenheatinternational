					We have partnered with the Ugandan Ministry of Energy to provide sustainable energy solutions in schools.

					In 2014 we constructed 10 bio-latrines to reduce reliance on wood fuel. Following the project’s success, Green Heat has been commissioned to construct a further 10 bio-latrines in 2015. For one of our largest projects to date, we installed a 120m<sup>3</sup> digester for the National Teachers College in Kaliro, Uganda.
