heading: Clean Energy Briquettes
intro: Our briquettes, formed from dried banana peelings and charcoal dust, are a clean fuel alternative to wood and charcoal. We work with over 120 Ugandan farmers, utilising their agricultural waste to form bio-char. Employing female sales partners, we have provided 490 tons of briquettes to over 770 new clients in the past year.

    text: Green Heat briquettes have a higher bulk density and lower moisture content compared to conventional biomass. Replacing charcoal with briquettes allows for significant smoke reduction during ignition and longer burning times, making fuel go further and saving money for our customers.

  - heading: Why Briquettes?
    text: The uniform shape and strength helps maintain constant temperatures and leads to less char wastage. Briquettes are odourless as they contain minimal evaporative substances. They are also safer, as no sparks are produced, unlike wood charcoal. Our clean fuel alternative can be used in all conventional biomass stoves, replacing wood and charcoal.
